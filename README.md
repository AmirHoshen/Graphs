# About
this project represent a **Directed Graph** with algorithms to manipulate the graph.
In this assignment we have developed a data structure, algorithms and Graphical User Interface. The assignment deals with the development of a data structure of deliberate weighted graph. After implement the Data structure, we implement algorithms such as the shortest path from source vertex to a destination vertex, if the graph is connected and several more.
this Project contains **five main classes**

# Project Classes
 - edgeData- 
 this class represents a directed edge between two vertexes in a Directed Graph going through source vertex to destination vertex and a set of operations applicable on them.

 - nodeData-
 this class represents vertexes in a Directed Graph and a set of operations applicable on them.

 - DGraph-
 this class represents a data structure of deliberate weighted and directed graph.

 - Graph_GUI-
 this class ilustrate this project , demonstraiting manipulations on a Graph using a graphic user intraface to explore and visualize the graph, with the use of StDdraw library.

 - Graph Algo- 
 this class represent the different algorithms that can be done on this graph.
